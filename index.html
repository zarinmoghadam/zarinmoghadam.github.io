        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p align="justify">My name is <strong>Zarin Moghadam</strong>. I'm a <strong>Nanochemistry</strong> graduate from the University of Tehran and currently, I’m looking for opportunities to continue my education as a PhD student. My research interest is focused on nanoparticles synthesis, supramolecular chemistry and their applications. I’ve started my career in Nanochemistry and I have worked on <strong>Metal-organic frameworks (MOF)</strong> and coordination polymers during my master’s. As Nanochemistry graduate, I am interested in researches focusing on nanoparticles synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, coordination polymer, porous materials, and their applications

        
        <p align="justify">I studied Nanochemistry under the supervision of Dr Kamran Akhbari at the University of Tehran. My thesis is about solid-state conversion in Inorganic Nano Supramolecular via ionexchange and absorption and desorption processes of guest or coordinated molecules. In order to achieve this goal, I synthesized two novel coordination polymers during my studies, I have investigated the effects of ultrasonic irradiation, different concentration, and solvents on new potassium coordination polymer, which led to the acceptance of a paper in the applied organometallic chemistry journal (doi:10.1002/aoc.4613). Also, the ability of adsorption and desorption of water in another coordination polymer was studied which led to the acceptance of a paper in polyhedron journal (doi:10.1016/j.poly.2018.07.014). I’ve also worked on Metal-organic frameworks. In this project, we reported the solid-state structural transformation of a Metal-organic framework to a nonporous coordination polymer upon thermal treatment. Also, the adsorption of guest molecules in a MOF was studied. The results of this study can be found in the paper that has been accepted in the Polyhedron journal (doi:10.1016/j.poly.2018.09.009). I also have a paper, which was accepted in the Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, which is about solid-state chemistry (doi:10.1016/j.jorganchem.2018.02.041). In addition, I published a mini-review in the NCRJournal (doi: 10.22036/ncr.2017.02.012). It worth to note that, I have developed several analytical skills such as X-ray, SEM and TEM, TG and DTA methods during my studies.</p>

        <p align="justify">As for my professional experience, I worked in a company as a researcher on calcium silicate as dental materials. In order to achieve this goal, we tried to synthesize different calcium silicate phases as the main material of the dental composite. Also, during this work, we synthesized nanoporous silica for improving the properties of our product. Moreover, I studied on bioactive Thursday, January 9, 2020 glass-ceramics. I recently started to work in Oligen Group as a QC expert and researcher.</p>
